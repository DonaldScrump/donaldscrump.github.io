                        abstract: "In this paper, we study the <i>fault-tolerant matroid median</i> and <i>fault-tolerant knapsack median</i> problems, \
                            wherein we are given facilities with opening costs, clients with connection costs, and a matroid or knapsack constraint \
                            on the facility-set. The goal is to open facilities that satisfy the constraint, assign $r\\geq1$ distinct open facilities \
                            to each client and minimize the sum of facility-opening and client-connection costs. These two problems generalize many \
                            fundamental clustering and facility location problems, such as fault-tolerant $k$-median, fault-tolerant facility location, \
                            matroid median, knapsack median, etc.<br> \
                            We present a versatile iterative rounding framework and obtain a unifying constant factor approximation algorithm for the \
                            two aforementioned problems. The framework improves upon the LP rounding algorithm for fault-tolerant $k$-median by \
                            Hajiaghayi <i>et&nbsp;al.</i> [SODA 2014], where they cast an optimal solution to the natural relaxation as a solution to an auxiliary \
                            LP defined by two laminar families and obtain an integral solution. The technical challenges here are primarily due to the \
                            more general matroid and knapsack constraints which render the auxiliary LP non-integral. We devise an algorithmic framework \
                            that iteratively removes one of the laminar families and ultimately obtain an integral solution."},

                        authors: "Shichuan Deng, Qianfan Zhang", conference: "Preprint, 2020",
                        abstract: "In this paper, we study <i>robust ordered $k$-median</i> and <i>fault-tolerant ordered $k$-median</i> as two novel \
                            generalizations of the <i>ordered $k$-median</i> problem. In ordered $k$-median, given a finite metric space $(X,d)$, \
                            we seek to open a set of $k$ facilities $S\\subseteq X$ which induces a <i>service cost vector</i> $\\vec{c}=\\{d(j,S):j\\in X\\}$, \
                            and minimize the objective $w^\\top\\vec{c}^\\downarrow$. Here $d(j,S)=\\min_{i\\in S}d(j,i)$ is the minimum distance between \
                            $j$ and open facilities in $S$, $w\\in\\mathbb{R}^{|X|}$ is a predefined non-increasing non-negative vector, and $\\vec{c}^\\downarrow$ \
                            is the non-increasingly sorted version of $\\vec{c}$. The current best result for ordered $k$-median is a $(5+\\epsilon)$-approximation \
                            [Chakrabarty and Swamy, STOC 2019].<br> \
                            We first consider robust ordered $k$-median, also known as ordered $k$-median with outliers, where the input consists \
                            of an ordered $k$-median instance and an additional parameter $m\\in\\mathbb{Z}_+$. The goal is to open $k$ facilities $S$, \
                            select $m$ clients $T\\subseteq X$ and assign the nearest open facility to each client $j\\in T$. In this case, the service \
                            cost vector is $\\vec{c}=\\{d(j,S):j\\in T\\}$, the vector $w$ is in $\\mathbb{R}^m$, and the objective is $w^\\top\\vec{c}^\\downarrow$. \
                            We introduce a novel yet simple objective function that enables linear analysis of the non-linear ordered objective, apply an \
                            iterative rounding framework [Krishnaswamy <i>et&nbsp;al.</i>, STOC 2018] and obtain a constant-factor approximate solution. We then \
                            devise the first constant-factor approximation algorithms for <i>ordered matroid median</i> and <i>ordered knapsack median</i> \
                            using the same method.<br> \
                            We also consider the fault-tolerant ordered $k$-median problem, where besides the same input as standard ordered $k$-median, \
                            we are also given additional client <i>requirements</i> $\\{r_j\\in\\mathbb{Z}_+:j\\in X\\}$ and need to assign $r_j$ distinct open \
                            facilities to each client $j\\in X$. The service cost of $j$ is the sum of distances to its assigned facilities, and the objective \
                            is still $w^\\top\\vec{c}^\\downarrow$. We obtain a constant-factor approximation algorithm using a novel LP relaxation with \
                            constraints created via a new sparsification technique.",},

                        authors: "Shichuan Deng", conference: "Preprint, 2020",
                        abstract: "In many fundamental combinatorial optimization problems, a feasible solution induces some real <i>cost vectors</i> as an \
                            intermediate result, and the optimization objective is a certain function of the vectors. For example, in the problem of \
                            <i>makespan minimization on unrelated parallel machines</i>, a feasible job assignment induces a vector containing the \
                            sizes of assigned jobs for each machine, and the goal is to minimize the $L_\\infty$ norm of $L_1$ norms of the vectors. \
                            Another example is <i>fault-tolerant $k$-center</i>, where each client is connected to multiple open facilities, thus \
                            having a vector of distances to these facilities, and the goal is to minimize the $L_\\infty$ norm of $L_\\infty$ norms of \
                            these vectors.<br> \
                            In this paper, we study the <i>maximum of norm</i> problem. Given an arbitrary symmetric monotone norm $f$, the objective \
                            is defined as the <i>maximum</i> ($L_\\infty$ norm) <i>of $f$-norm</i> values of the induced cost vectors. This versatile \
                            formulation captures a wide variety of problems, including makespan minimization, fault-tolerant $k$-center and many others. \
                            We give concrete results for load balancing on unrelated parallel machines and clustering problems, including constant-factor \
                            approximation algorithms when $f$ belongs with a certain rich family of norms, and $O(\\log n)$-approximations when $f$ is \
                            general and satisfies some mild assumptions.<br> \
                            We also consider the aforementioned problems in a generalized fairness setting. As a concrete example, the insight is to \
                            prevent a scheduling algorithm from assigning <i>too many</i> jobs consistently on any machine in a job-recurring scenario, \
                            and causing the machine's controller to fail. Our algorithm needs to stochastically output a feasible solution minimizing \
                            the objective function, and satisfy the given marginal fairness constraints.",},

                        authors: "Shichuan Deng, Jian Li, Yuval Rabani.", conference: "ESA 2020",
                        abstract: "In many classic clustering problems, we seek to sketch a massive data set of $n$ points \
                            (a.k.a <i>clients</i>) in a metric space, by segmenting them into $k$ categories or clusters, \
                            each cluster represented concisely by a single point in the metric space (a.k.a. the cluster's \
                            <i>center</i> or its <i>facility</i>). \
                            The goal is to find such a sketch that minimizes some objective that depends on the \
                            distances between the clients and their respective facilities \
                            (the objective is a.k.a. the <i>service cost</i>). \
                            Two notable examples are the $k$-center/$k$-supplier problem where the objective is to \
                            minimize the maximum distance from any client to its facility, and the $k$-median \
                            problem where the objective is to minimize the sum over all clients of the distance \
                            from the client to its facility.<br> \
                            In practical applications of clustering, the data set may evolve over time, reflecting \
                            an evolution of the underlying clustering model. Thus, in such applications, a good \
                            clustering must simultaneously represent the temporal data set well, but also not \
                            change too drastically between time steps. In this paper, we initiate the study of a \
                            dynamic version of clustering problems that aims to capture these considerations. In \
                            this version there are $T$ time steps, and in each time step $t\\in\\{1,2,\\dots,T\\}$, the set of clients \
                            needed to be clustered may change, and we can move the $k$ facilities \
                            between time steps. The general goal is to minimize certain combinations \
                            of the service cost and the \
                            facility movement cost, or minimize one subject to some constraints on the other. \
                            More specifically, we study two concrete problems in this framework: \
                            the <i>Dynamic Ordered $k$-Median</i> and the <i>Dynamic $k$-Supplier</i> problem. \
                            Our technical contributions are as follows: \
                            <ul> \
                                <li>We consider the Dynamic Ordered $k$-Median problem, where \
                                the objective is to minimize the weighted sum of ordered distances over all time steps, \
                                plus the total cost of moving the facilities between time steps. We present one constant-factor \
                                approximation algorithm for $T=2$ and another approximation algorithm for fixed $T\\geq3$. \
                                </li> \
                                <li>We consider the Dynamic $k$-Supplier problem, where the objective is to minimize the maximum distance \
                                    from any client to its facility, subject to the constraint that between time steps the maximum distance \
                                    moved by any facility is no more than a given threshold. \
                                    When the number of time steps $T$ is 2, we present a simple constant \
                                    factor approximation algorithm and a bi-criteria constant factor approximation algorithm for the outlier \
                                    version, where some of the clients can be discarded. We also show that it is NP-hard to approximate the \
                                    problem with any factor for $T\\geq3$. \
